# React Web App quick start with CRA, Redux, Saga and Material UI

## Who's the Starter for?

This starter is for those with basic knowledge of React and Redux have the need for building a mature React Application with state requirements in Lagash. You can treat this application as an example of how a non-trivial app needs to be structured.
If you feel intimidated by all the understanding needed to develop a complex application, dont' worry, we've been all there!
See it as an opportunity to learn lot of cool stuff and also to interact with your team mates in Lagash.

If you need you create a trivial application, without retrieving information from any source, this may be overkill. If you have any doubts, ask! Don't be shy.

## Requirements

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.0
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 6.0

## Getting Started

**1. You can start by cloning the repository on your local machine by running:**

```bash
git clone --depth=1  https://gitlab.lagash.com/quickstarts/create-react-app-redux-saga-material-ui.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

**2. Install all of the dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Addition of .env file:**

```file
REACT_APP_URL_API=http://localhost
REACT_APP_PORT_API=27115
```

[comment]: # 'REACT_APP_PORT_API is set in \api\Bonvivir.WebApi\Properties\launchSettings.json, depends on the enviroment that is used when the app is run.'

**4. Start to run it:**

```bash
npm start           # Runs development mode
npm run start:prod  # Runs production mode
```

At this point you can see the example app at http://localhost:3000

**5. Running tests:**

```bash
npm test          #runs unit tests
npm run e2e:open  #runs end to end tests
npm run e2e:run   #runs end to end tests (CI environment)
```

**6. Code checks/linting:**

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

**7. NPM check dependencies:**

```bash
npm run check:deps
```

## Tech Stack

As stated before, this _quickstart_ aims to the development of modern and rich application and thus requires modern tools and techniques.

If you're completely new to React, please refer to the [react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto). Its a great starting point.

Here's a curated list of packages that you should be at least familiar with before starting your project. However, the best way to see a complete list of the dependencies is to check [package.json](https://gitlab.lagash.com/quickstarts/create-react-app-redux-saga-material-ui/blob/master/package.json).

## Setup React Dev Tools

Follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)

## Setup Redux DevTools Extension

The [Redux Devtools Extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/) let us wire up our Redux app to a time-traveling debugger. It's enabled in development only. You can follow these installation guides to use it:

**For Chrome**

- from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd);
- or build it with `npm i && npm run build:extension` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./build/extension`;
- or run it in dev mode with `npm i && npm start` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./dev`.

**For Firefox**

- from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)
- or build it with `npm i && npm run build:firefox` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) `./build/firefox` (just select a file from inside the dir).
